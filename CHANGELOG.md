## 2.3.0-pre.10-dev
#### 10/8/13
- Adding CHANGELOG.md to root of project for API related changes between releases (should probably keep previous dates separated by release for up to several minor releases).
- Change to enyo.Model `parse` method handling, before it was confusing to developers because it was only executed under specific circumstances (there were reasons for this) but now it will be executed on all fetched data and all data passed to the constructor (when call `new enyo.Model` and passing attributes, or when it is created using `enyo.store.createRecord` or an _enyo.Collection_ instantiates it). This does require that the method checks to see what data is being passed in if it was relying on this method to reformat fields or meta-properties from remote data but also creates local records that already have the correct data format.
- Change to enyo.Model `merge` strategy that now accepts instanced record(s) or data hash(es), can merge without forcing the record to be instanced, and to remain inline with the `parse` method change will parse any data being merged if it is a data hash (not if it is an instanced record). This method no longer accepts the optional second parameter.
- Change to enyo.Model `add` method that no longer accepts optional third parameter and will automatically call the model's `parse` method if it is a data-hash (not an instanced record).
