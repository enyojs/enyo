# Contributions

We welcome community contributions to Enyo and its associated libraries.

Please see [Contributing to Enyo](http://enyojs.com/community/contribute/) for
details on our contribution policy and guidelines for use of the
`Enyo-DCO-1.1-Signed-off-by` line in your commits and pull requests.

We have a brief [Style
Guide](http://enyojs.com/docs/latest/developer-guide/best-practices/style-guide.html)
for code going into our repos.  In addition, we've added `.jshintrc`
files to the root directories of the various code bases, and ask that you make
your code reasonably clean with respect to the [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) tool
before submitting.  We know that there are sometimes issues with how JSHint
handles indentation levels with JavaScript data structures that affect kind
definitions, so we are prepared to give some leeway in that area.

If you're interested in introducing new kinds, you might also consider hosting
your own repo and contributing to the [Enyo Community
Gallery](http://enyojs.com/gallery).
