# Contributions

Contributions are welcome for Enyo and its associated libraries including onyx and layout.

Please see [Contributing to Enyo](http://enyojs.com/community/contribute/) for details
on our contribution policy and guidelines for use of the Enyo-DCO-1.1-Signed-off-by
line in your commits and pull requests.

We have a brief
[Enyo JS style guide](https://github.com/enyojs/enyo/wiki/Style-Guide)
for code going into the repo. We've recently added .jshintrc
files to the root of the various code bases, and ask that you make your code
reasonable clean to the [JS Hint](http://jshint.com/) tool before submitting.
We know that there are issues sometimes with how jshint handles indentation
levels with JS data structures that affect kind definitions, so we give a
little leeway.

If you're interested in introducing new kinds, you might also consider hosting
your own repo and contributing to the [Enyo community gallery](http://enyojs.com/gallery).
