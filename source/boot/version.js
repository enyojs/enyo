/*
	Each Enyo-provided library will annotate this structure with its own
	version info. Why? In general, Enyo and its libraries are versioned
	and released together, but libraries may be versioned separately in
	the future. Also, since libraries are checked out and updated
	individually, a project may be using "mismatched" libraries at any
	given time (e.g., the last stable release of Enyo, but an
	unreleased checkout from the master branch of layout).

	Enyo uses semantic versioning. Official releases have version
	numbers	of the form "X.y.z". Prereleases are indicated by a suffix
	of the form "-pre.N" where N is incremented for each prerelease.
	Between releases, version numbers include an additional "-dev"
	suffix.
