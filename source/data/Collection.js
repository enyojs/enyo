/**
	_enyo.Collection_ is an array-like structure that houses collections of
	[enyo.Model](#enyo.Model) instances. A collection may be set as the
	_controller_ property of an [enyo.Control](#enyo.Control) or declared in the
	_controllers_ block of an _enyo.Application_. Collections are read-only
	entities in terms of retrieving and setting data via an
	[enyo.Source](#enyo.Source). The implementation of observers and events is the
	same as in _enyo.Model_.

	A collection lazily instantiates records when they are requested. This is 
	important to keep in mind with respect to the order of operations.

	Collection objects generate _add_, _remove_, and _destroy_ events that may be
	listened for using the _addListener()_ method.
