		_enyo.Model_ is a kind used to create data records. For the sake of
		efficiency and simplicity, it has been designed as a special object not
		derived from any other Enyo kind.

		__Getting and Setting enyo.Model values__

		Unlike kinds based on [enyo.Object](#enyo.Object), any call to	_set()_ or
		_get()_ on a model affects only the schema of the model, which is tracked in
		its _attributes_ hash. That is, when you set a property	on a model via
		_set()_, you are setting the property's entry in the model's _attributes_
		hash, not setting the property on the model itself.

		Note that, even though you are changing the contents of the _attributes_
		hash, you should not specify _"attributes"_ as a parameter to _set()_ or
		_get()_. If you do so, you will create a schema object called _"attributes"_
		nested inside the model's _attributes_ hash.

		Also note that the _set()_ method has the ability to accept a hash of keys
		and values to be applied to the model all at once.

		__Computed Properties and enyo.Model__

		Computed properties only exist for attributes of a model. Otherwise, they
		function as you would expect from
		[ComputedSupport](#enyo/source/kernel/mixins/ComputedSupport.js) on
		_enyo.Object_. The only exception is that all functions in the attributes
		schema are considered to be computed properties; these are fairly useless,
		however, if you don't declare any dependencies that they have.

		__Bindings__

		An _enyo.Model_ may be at the receiving end of a binding, but bindings
		cannot be created on the model itself. If a model has a _bindings_ array, it
		will be ignored.

		__Observers and Notifications__

		While there is no _observers_ block for _enyo.Model_, bindings may still be
		applied to attributes of the model. The notification system for observers
		works the same as it does with _enyo.Object_, except that observers are only
		notified of changes made to properties in the _attributes_ hash.

		__Events__

		The events in _enyo.Model_ differ from those in
		[enyo.Component](#enyo.Component). Instead of _bubbled_ or _waterfall_
		events, _enyo.Model_ has _change_ and _destroy_ events.

		To work with these events, use [addListener()](#enyo.Model::addListener),
		[removeListener()](#enyo.Model::removeListener), and
		[triggerEvent()](#enyo.Model::triggerEvent).
