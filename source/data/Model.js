		## Getting and Setting _enyo.Model_ values

		An _enyo.Model_ is a special object not derived from other enyo _kinds_. This is
		for efficiency and simplicity. That being said, any `set` or `get` call on a _model_
		will work only with the _schema_ of the _model_ and not as you would expect other
		kinds based on _enyo.Object_. Any property set via the `set` method will be assumed
		an `attribute` of the _model schema_. The `set` method also has the ability to accept
		a hash of _keys_ and _values_ to apply at once. Even though the schema is tracked via
		the `attributes` hash of the model it is __not necessary to prefix get/set paths with
		"attributes" as this is assumed and redundant and will cause it to created a nested
		schema object called `attributes`__.

		## Computed Properties and _enyo.Model_

		Computed properties only exist for attributes of a _model_. Otherwise, they function
		as you would expect from _ComputedSupport_ on _enyo.Object_. The only other exception
		is that all _functions_ in the _attributes schema_ are considered to be a _computed
		property_, they are fairly useless, however, without a declaration for any dependencies
		they might have.

		## Bindings

		An _enyo.Model_ can be at the receiving end of a binding but bindings cannot be created
		on the _model_ itself. A _bindings_ array will be ignored.

		## Observers and Notifications

		There is no _observers_ block for _enyo.Model_. _Bindings_ can still be applied to _attributes_
		of the _model_. Notifications for _observers_ works the same as with _enyo.Object_ except they
		only apply to changes made on properties in the _attributes_.

		## Events

		Events are different than those in _enyo.Component_. There are no _bubbled_ or _waterfall_
		events. Instead, you can use the registered listeners for events via the `addListener`,
		`removeListener`, and `triggerEvent` API.

		For _enyo.Model_, generated events are "change" and "destroy".
