			Queries a source for a record (or records), with the ability to use

			asynchronous method that requires two parameters--the kind of record to
			use (in the form of a constructor or string), and an options hash that
			includes a _success_ method, an optional _fail_ method, a _source_
			designating the source to use (or else the record kind's default will be
			used), a _strategy_ (explained below), and a hash of _attributes_ to use
			in the query. How these attributes are used in the query depends on the
			source being used. The _success_ method expects to receive the original
			options hash passed into _find()_, followed by the result set (returned by
			the _strategy_, as explained below).

			There is a special use for this method if an _euid_ or _primaryKey_ value
			is provided (the _euid_ directly on the options hash; the _primaryKey_ in
			the _attributes_ hash of the options). In this case, the method will
			attempt to find the record locally first; if it is found, the _success_
			method will be called and the source will not be queried. If the record
			cannot be found locally, the method will proceed normally. Regardless of
			whether the source is used, whenever the _euid_ or _primaryKey_ value is
			provided, the result will be either a single record or _undefined_; it
			will not be an array.

			For queries against runtime records only (i.e., records in the store), see
			_findLocal()_.

			When results are retrieved from the requested source, they will be handled
			according to the requested _strategy_ (the default is _merge_). Strategies
			may easily be extended by creating a method on the store of the form
			_&lt;name&gt;Strategy_, and then setting the _name_ as the _strategy_ option
			passed to this method. The strategy resolvers receive two parameters--the
			current array of records for the kind in the original request, and the
			incoming results from the source query. These methods are executed under
			the context of the store.

			There are two available strategies: _replace_ and _merge_.

			* When the _replace_ strategy is used, all known records are thrown away
				(though not destroyed) and replaced by the new results.

			* When using the _merge_ strategy (the default), any incoming records with
				the same _primaryKey_ as records already in the store are updated with
				the values retrieved, and new records are simply added to the store.

			this method or provide an optional third parameter that may be a function
