        An _enyo.Application_ can be used to coordinate execution of
        a given collection of _enyo_ objects. There can be one or more
        _enyo.Applications_ running (with some limitation such as which is
        rendered into the _document.body_ - no limitation if they are each
        rendered into separate DOM nodes or nested). It also provides the
        ability to namespace and automatically initialize any _controllers_
        of the application.
        
        Typically the namespace that the _enyo.Application_ is subclassed
        into will be used as the namespace of any singleton controllers
        implemented at initialization.
        
        For example, if you subclass _enyo.Application_ as the following:
        
        enyo.kind({
            name: "MyApp.Application",
            kind: "enyo.Application",
            controllers: [
                {name: "contactsController", kind: "MyApp.ContactsController"}
            ]
        })
        
        it will instantiate the singleton _contactsController_ as
        _MyApp.contactsController_. Any bindings of the application object
        or any other object in-or-outside-of the application can reference
        this controller by that path as long as the application's _start_
        method has been called.
        
        You can explicitly include a separate namespace for a controller in
        its name property if necessary. The path is not restricted to existing
        namespaces and can be as deep as needed, for example:
        
        {name: "My.Controllers.Namespace.That.Is.Stupidly.Deep.controller"...}
