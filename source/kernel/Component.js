/**
	_enyo.Component_ is the fundamental building block for Enyo applications.
	Components are designed to fit together, so that complex behaviors may be
	fashioned from smaller bits of functionality.

	## Configurations

	Component constructors take a single argument (sometimes called a
	_Component configuration_), a JavaScript object that defines various
	properties to be initialized on the Component.  For example:

		// create a new component, initialize its name property to 'me'.
		var c = new enyo.Component({
			name: "me"
		});

	When a Component is instantiated, items configured in its _components_
	property are instantiated, too:

		// create a new component, which itself has a component
		var c = new enyo.Component({
			name: "me",
			components: [
				{kind: "Component", name: "other"}
			]
		});
	
	In this case, when _me_ is created, _other_ is also created, and we say that
	_me owns other_.  In other words, the _owner_ property of _other_ equals
	_me_.  Notice that you can specify the _kind_ of _other_ explicitly in its
	configuration block, to tell _me_ what constructor to use to create _other_.

	Note that _kind_ values may be references to actual kinds or string-names of
	kinds.  Kind names that	do not resolve directly to kinds are looked up in
	default namespaces.  In this case, _kind: "Component"_ resolves to
	_enyo.Component_.
	
	## Ownership

	The concept of ownership allows us to organize components into trees, e.g.:

	* Component A
		* Component B (owner: A)
		* Component C (owner: A)
			* Component E (owner: C)
		* Component D (owner A)

	Note that, when designing code, a component should only be concerned with
	the components it owns (one level down).  The coder never needs to worry
	about the complex tree structure that exists at runtime.  For example,
	Component A will never reference Component E directly; it will only access
	the interface supplied by Component C.

	The ownership status of a component is controlled by the _owner_ property,
	so, to change ownership of a component,	use the _setOwner_ method.

	Every component has a name, and its name must be unique among all the
	components of its owner.  In other words, a component can't own two
	components with the same name.  A component may access its owned components
	by name using the _$_ hash.

	For example, if a component owns components named 'componentB' and
	'componentC', it can refer to them with code like this:

		someMethod: function() {
			this.$.componentB.doWork();
			this.$.componentC.doWork();
		}

	Sometimes we refer to the set of objects in a component's _$_ hash as the
	component's _scope_.

	Note that all components visible in the _components_ property will be owned
	by the top-level component. For example:

		// create a new component, which owns several components
		var c = new enyo.Component({
			name: "me",
			components: [
				{name: "other", components: [
					{name: "third"},
					{name: "fourth"}
				]}
			]
		});

	Although the components _third_ and _fourth_ are nested inside the
	configuration for _other_, they are still owned by _me_.  This concept is
	important; it means that whatever components you can see listed are in the
	top-level component's scope.

	The _me_ component might have a complex configuration, but we can see at a
	glance that it has access to _other_, _third_, and _fourth_ to get its work
	done.  Those objects will be available in the _$_ hash.

	## Events

	A component can send a message to its owner using the _event_ mechanism.  A
	component exposes events as string properties whose	names begin with "on".
	To listen to messages, a component may assign the name of one of its methods
	to the event property of an owned component.
	
	For example, the _WebService_ component has an _onSuccess_ property.  The
	owner of a WebService can set _onSuccess_ to the name of a method to be
	called when the WebService operation completes successfully.

		// create a new component, which has a component of its own, and listens
		// for an event
		var c = new enyo.Component({
			name: "MyComponent",
			components: [
				{kind: "WebService", onSuccess: "webSuccess"}
			],
			webSuccess: function(inSender) {
				this.log(inSender.name, "was successful");
			}
		});

	We call _webSuccess_ the _delegate_ for the _success_ event of the
	WebService.  Because the event properties take method names as values, we
	call the event property values _named delegates_.

	Note that the _webSuccess_ method takes an argument called _inSender_, which
	refers to the object that generated the event.  Different events may supply
	additional arguments, but they all supply _inSender_ as the first argument.

	Component events are much like DOM events.  In fact, Enyo makes many DOM
	events available as component events.  Remember that Ccmponents do not, in
	general, represent DOM nodes, but _Controls_ do; see the
	<a href="#enyo.Control">Control</a> documentation for more information.

	## Create and Destroy

	When a component is instantiated, and after all constructors are executed,
	the _create_ method is invoked.  During _Component.create_, all owned
	components are created.

	Subclasses of Component often override _create_ to do initialization tasks.
	If you override Component, make sure to call the inherited _create_ method,
	and remember that owned components (and the _$_ hash) are only ready after
	_this.inherited()_ has returned.

		enyo.kind({
			name: "MyComponent",
			kind: enyo.Component,
			create: function() {
				// I can do tasks before my components are created
				this.inherited(arguments);
				// ... or I can do tasks after, my $ hash is ready now
			}
		});

	To delete a component, use the _destroy_ method.  Calling _destroy_ on a
	component will remove it from all framework	bookkeeping, and in particular
	will set its owner to _null_.  Generally, this will be enough to allow the
	object to be garbage-collected, unless you have maintained a reference to it
	yourself.

		allDone: function() {
			// remove workComponent, and do any cleanup
			this.$.workComponent.destroy();
			// now this.$.workComponent is undefined
		}

	You may override the _destroy_ method to include custom cleanup code.
	Again, you must make sure to call the inherited method before returning.

	## Creating Components Dynamically

	The _createComponent_ and _createComponents_ methods are included to create
	components dynamically.	 Refer to the inline documentation for those methods
	for more information.
