/**
_enyo.Object_ implements the Enyo framework's property publishing system, as
well as providing several utility functions for its subkinds.

Published properties are declared in a hash called _published_ within a call
to _enyo.kind_. Getter and setter methods are automatically generated for
properties declared in this manner. Also, by convention, the setter for a
published property will trigger an optional _&lt;propertyName&gt;Changed_ method
when called.

For more information, see the [documentation on Published
Properties](https://github.com/enyojs/enyo/wiki/Published-Properties) in the
Enyo Developer Guide.
