/**
_enyo.Object_ lies at the heart of the Enyo framework's implementations of
property publishing, computed properties (via the _ComputedPropertySupport_
mixin), and data binding (via the _BindingSupport_ mixin). It also provides
several utility functions for its subkinds.

Published properties are declared in a hash called _published_ within a call
to _enyo.kind_. To get and set values for these properties, call
_get(&lt;propertyName&gt;)_ and _set(&lt;propertyName&gt;, &lt;value&gt;)_,
respectively.

By convention, the setter for a published property will trigger an optional
_&lt;propertyName&gt;Changed_ method when called.

For more information, see the [documentation on Published
Properties](https://github.com/enyojs/enyo/wiki/Published-Properties) in the
Enyo Developer Guide.
