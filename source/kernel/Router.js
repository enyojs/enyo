	/**
		_enyo.Router_ is a controller with the ability to interpret changes
		in the url as well as set changes to the url in a manner that is
		compatible across browsers. With defined route handling, the
		application state can be managed more closely with respect to the
		location state of the browser. There may be multiple router instances
		active at any one time. Routers only interact with the hash portion
		of the browser location and will not force a reload of the current
		page.

		Routes may be defined in several ways and may be added at	startup or
		added programmatically at a later time.

		A route is a declarative hash with the following structure:

			{path: "some/path", handler: "function", context: "context"}

		The path is a string that may be static (explicitly matched) or
		dynamic (matched based on dynamic placeholders). Dynamic paths
		may name elements to be matched, e.g.:

			{path: ":user/:id"}

		In this case, the handler would be called with two parameters
		filled with the values matched by that structure. It is important
		to note that a dynamic route will apply the first match it finds,
		so care must be used to ensure that the correct route is matched
		(e.g., `/users/:user/:id` is more exact because of the static
		`users` portion of the path).

		The handler may be a function reference or a string that will be
		mapped to a function. A check for the function's existence is
		conducted first on the router, then on any provided context, and
		finally in the global scope. If a context is provided, the
		function will be executed under that context regardless of where
		the function was found.

		The context property may be an object, an instance or a string that
		will be mapped to an object if possible.

		Note that, currently, only letters and numbers are supported in
		dynamic routes.  Also, because we support IE8, we do not currently
		support _pushState_.
