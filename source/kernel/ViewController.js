/**
	The _enyo.ViewController_ is designed to manage the lifecycle of a
	particular _view_ (enyo.Control) that it owns. It has the capability of
	being used to control when a _view_ is inserted into the DOM, where, manage
	events bubbled from the _view_, and isolate (or encapsulate) the entire _view_
	hierarchy below it. In other use-cases it could be implemented as a _component_
	in a larger hierarchy and instead of injecting its _view_ into the DOM directly
	will insert it into its _parent_. Of course it can also be used on the _controller_
	property of another _view_ although this would remove its own _view_ from the
	_enyo.Component_ bubbling hierarchy (by default).

		be set later. Setting this property to a constructor (or a string naming a _kind_) when active 
		will automatically create an instance of that kind according to any of the settings for this
