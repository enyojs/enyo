		Computed properties are methods of kinds that are designated as being
		dependent upon multiple properties--much like observers, except that
		they themselves are treated as properties (not functions). An
		_enyo.Binding_ cannot be bound to a function directly, but it can be
		bound to a computed property.

		Computed properties have the advantage of being cacheable (meaning that many
		requests for the property won't require pointless recalculations) and will
		notify observers when any of their own dependencies change. Computed
		properties may be called directly, and will accept parameters just like other
		functions, but be aware	that you cannot call any setter method for a
		computed property. Also note that for any observers of a computed property,
		there will never be a _previous_ value unless it is cached.

		Just as with [ObserverSupport](#enyo/source/kernel/mixins/ObserverSupport.js),
		you can specify that a method is a computed property by including it within a
		_computed_ block.

			enyo.kind({
				name: "Sample",
				computed: {
					mood: ["expression", "posture", "volume", {cached: true}],
					maxHours: []
				}
			})

		Another feature of computed properties is the ability to add configurable
		options. Options are found in the computed property's array of dependencies.
		Look at the defaults for options of computed properties to see what options
		are available.
