/** 
	_GroupItem_ is the base kind for the Grouping API. Manages the active state of the component 
	(or inheriting component). A sub-kind may call _setActive_ to set the _active_ property to the 
	desired state which will additionally bubble an _onActivate_ event that can be handled as 
	necessary by the containing components. This is useful for creating groups of items that 
	require their state managed as a group.
	
	An example of using the _onActivate_ event can be seen in the <a href="#enyo.Group">enyo.Group</a>
	kind, which enables the	creation of radio groups from arbitrary components that support the
	Grouping API.
