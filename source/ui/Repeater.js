/**
	_enyo.Repeater_ is a simple control for making lists of items.

	Components of a repeater are copied for each item created, and are wrapped
	in a control that keeps the state of the item index.

	Example:

		{kind: "Repeater", count: 2, onSetupItem: "setImageSource", components: [
			{kind: "Image"}
		]}

		setImageSource: function(inSender, inEvent) {
			var index = inEvent.index;
			var item = inEvent.item;
			item.$.image.setSrc(this.imageSources[index]);
			return true;
		}

	Be sure to return true from your _onSetupItem_ handler to avoid having other
	event handlers further up the tree try to modify your item control.

	The repeater will always be rebuilt after a call to _setCount_, even if the
	count didn't change.  This differs from the behavior of most properties, in
	which no action happens when a set-value call doesn't modify the value.
	This is to accomodate potential changes to the data model for the repeater,
	which may happen to have the same item count as before.
