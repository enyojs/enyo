	_enyo.DataGridList_ is a paginated [enyo.DataList](#enyo.DataList) designed to
	lay out its children in a grid. Like _enyo.DataList_, it links its children
	directly to the underlying record in the collection set as its controller.
	Because the layout is arbitrarily handled, spacing of children must be set
	using the kind's available API (e.g., _spacing_, _minWidth_, _minHeight_).
	Note that _enyo.DataGridList_ will attempt to grow or shrink the size of its
	children in order to keep them evenly spaced.
