/**
	_enyo.DataList_ is an [enyo.DataRepeater](#enyo.DataRepeater) that employs a
	paginated scrolling scheme to enhance performance with larger datasets. The
	data is provided to the DataList by an [enyo.Collection](#enyo.Collection) set
	as the value of its _collection_ property.

	Note that care should be taken when deciding how to lay out the list's
	children. When there are a large number of child elements, the layout process
	can be taxing and non-performant for the browser. Avoid	dynamically-updated
	layouts that require lots of calculations each time the data in a view is
	updated. Try to use CSS whenever possible.

	While paging through data, _enyo.DataList_ emits the _paging_ event, which
	allows you to make updates on a per-page basis, as necessary. You may register
	for this event by calling _addListener()_ and specifying the event, along with
	a callback method.

	The callback method is passed a reference to the _enyo.DataList_, the name of
	the event (_"paging"_), and a hash with the properties _start_, _end_, and
	_action_, referring to the lowest active index in the dataset, the highest
	active index, and the action that triggered the paging, respectively. The
	value of _action_ value may be either _"scroll"_ or _"reset"_.
