less-plugin-prefixly
====================

Normalizes vendor prefix uses inside less files. Prefixly doesn't care if you used 
vendor prefixes, or not, it will compare the rules inside a set, and determine which
prefixes need to be added.

uses caniuse-db to keep up to date with prefixing.

build using browserify using grunt.
